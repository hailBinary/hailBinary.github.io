    <p>&nbsp;I'm a computer engineer or at least that's what I studied in college. I like building things that look cool
        and show intelligence.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Also as you can probably tell, I don't like CSS. Anyways this is my site
        where I'll showcase the projects I build.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>&nbsp;Here are some projects I made,</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/hailBinary/VisioAlgo">Visioalgo: A path finding and sorting visualiser</a>
                <br>
                Me and my friends made a pathfinding, djikstra and a*, and sorting, bubble and merge sort, algorithm
                visulaiser for our college project.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/hailBinary/Self-DrivingCar">Self-DrivingCar Simulation</a>
                <br>
                Made this one in pure javascript. A self driving car simulation operates on a feed forward neural net.
                The neural net saves the car that goes the farthest among many cars with slight variations and then uses
                the winning car to build the next generation of cars and so on. Was fun to build.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/hailBinary/GrabBag">GrabBag</a>
                <br>
                A clickable quiz game I made using p5.js for my college quiz game. There are 4 * 4 boxes and only 7 of
                them are correct. Click on the correct ones to win points.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>&nbsp;Some thoughts on what to do in life,</h3>
    <p id="thoughts">Life is difficult as is, don't make it more difficult by doing things that don't match with what
        you normally like to be doing. I like to be out and about talking to people and having new experiences. So any
        role or job that allows me to do that is basically my new role. So, from now on let's just aim to be freaking
        awesome at all times. <b>Above all do what looks like work but feels like play to you.</b></p>
