    &nbsp;I'm a computer engineer or at least that's what I studied in
    college. I like building things that look cool and show intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;I'll showcase the projects I build here along with any other stuff.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>Some of my builds,</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="./projects/poll_maker/index.htm">poll_maker</a><br />Make a poll where you can manually add in your own options and the poll count rises when you click on the option.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="./projects/url extractor/index.html">urlXtractor</a><br />Manually type in your URL separated by a line
        break and it will
        turn it into a list of clickable links. I learned to manipulate the
        DOM using JS from this project.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="./projects/BGcolorchange/index.htm">BGcolorchanger</a><br />Change background color by typing the color
        name as input. I
        learned to change css using JS from this project.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Projects I made in college,</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/hailBinary/VisioAlgo">Visioalgo: A path finding and sorting visualiser</a>
        <br />
        Me and my friends made a pathfinding, djikstra and a*, and sorting,
        bubble and merge sort, algorithm visulaiser for our college project.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/hailBinary/Self-DrivingCar">Self-DrivingCar Simulation</a>
        <br />
        Made this one in pure javascript. A self driving car simulation
        operates on a feed forward neural net. The neural net saves the car
        that goes the farthest among many cars with slight variations and then
        uses the winning car to build the next generation of cars and so on.
        Was fun to build.

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/hailBinary/GrabBag">GrabBag</a>
        <br />
        A clickable quiz game I made using p5.js for my college quiz game.
        There are 4 * 4 boxes and only 7 of them are correct. Click on the
        correct ones to win points.
      </p>

    <li>
      <p>
        RL enemy bots in an FPS shooter game
        <br />
        My final thesis for my undergraduate where we trained enemy bots using
        RL in unity for an fps shooter games. The bots showed intelligent
        behavior better than traditional bots.
