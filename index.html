    <hr>
    <p>&nbsp;I'm a computer engineer or at least that's what I studied in college. I like building things that look cool
        and show intelligence.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Also as you can probably tell, I don't like CSS. Anyways this is my site
        where I'll showcase the projects I build.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>&nbsp;Here are some projects I made,</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/hailBinary/VisioAlgo">Visioalgo: A path finding and sorting visualiser</a>
                <br>
                Me and my friends made a pathfinding, djikstra and a*, and sorting, bubble and merge sort, algorithm
                visulaiser for our college project.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/hailBinary/Self-DrivingCar">Self-DrivingCar Simulation:</a>
                <br>
                Made this one in pure javascript. A self driving car simulation operates on a feed forward neural net.
                The neural net saves the car that goes the farthest among many cars with slight variations and then uses
                the winning car to build the next generation of cars and so on. Was fun to build.
            </p>

            <p>
                <a href="https://github.com/hailBinary/Self-DrivingCar">GrabBag:</a>
                <br>
                A clickable quiz game I made using p5.js for my college quiz game. There are 4 * 4 boxes and only 7 of them are correct. Click on the correct ones to win points.
            </p>
